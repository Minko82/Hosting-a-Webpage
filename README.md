## 📝 **Description**

I just wanted to figure out how to host a basic webpage using **HTML** and **GitHub Pages** lol So here's a quick tutorial!

### ❗ **Important Notes**
- ❗GitHub Pages only supports **static websites**, so if you want to build something dynamic (like a React app) or with backend code, you'll need to configure other services❗
- After commiting a change, it'll take a few minutes for the updates to go live.

## 📂 **Project Setup**

Follow these simple steps to get your webpage hosted on GitHub Pages:

### 1. Create a new GitHub Repository
   - Set the repository to **Public**

<br>

### 2. Create your webpage (HTML File)
   - Add your html to your repository
   - ❗IMPORTANT❗ Name the main HTML page for your website `index.html`. This is the default name that GitHub Pages looks for when serving your page
   - Start with a simple HTML template to get started:
     
          <!DOCTYPE html>
          <html lang="en">
            <head>
              <meta charset="UTF-8" />
              <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
              <title>Welcome to My Webpage!</title>
            </head>
            <body>
              <h1>Hello World!</h1>
              <p>This is a basic webpage hosted on GitHub Pages. Let's get started!</p>
            </body>
         </html>

### 3. Commit Your Changes
