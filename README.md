## 📢 **Notes**

- ❗GitHub Pages only supports **static websites**, so if you want to build something dynamic (like a React app), you'll need to configure other services❗
- This method is great for showcasing portfolios, resumes, or personal projects.
- After commiting a change, it'll take a few minutes for the updates to go live.

## 📂 **Project Setup**

Follow these simple steps to get your webpage hosted on GitHub Pages:

   
### 1. **Add Your HTML File**
   - Add your html to your repository
   - ❗IMPORTANT❗ Name the file `index.html`. This is the default name that GitHub Pages looks for when serving your page

### 2. **Commit Your Changes**


### 3. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to the **"Settings"** tab of your repository.
   - Scroll down to the **"GitHub Pages"** section.
   - Under **"Source"**, select the branch that contains your `index.html` file (usually `main` or `master`).
   - After a few moments, GitHub will provide you with a URL where your page is hosted.
